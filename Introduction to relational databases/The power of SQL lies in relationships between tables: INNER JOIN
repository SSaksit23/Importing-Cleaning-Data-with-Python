-----------------------------------\\
The power of SQL lies in relationships between tables: INNER JOIN

# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT Title, Name FROM Album INNER JOIN Artist on Album.ArtistID = Artist.ArtistID")
      ### use SELECT columns Title and Name From Album data base
      ### INNER JOIN with the Artist database on the column ArtistID : Album.ArtistID, Assign the column as ArtistID.
          
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
      ### use the .fetchall() method on the database and conver to DataFrame with the method pd.DataFrame.
    df.columns = rs.keys()
      ### Assign the columns as the keys from the database.

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())

-----------------------------------\\
FILTERING the INNER Join 

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId WHERE Milliseconds < 250000', engine)
    ### use pd.read_sql_query(argu1, engine)
      ** argu1 : the SQL query.
      
# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
