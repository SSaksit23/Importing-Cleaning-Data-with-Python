Pandas and The Hello World of SQL Queries!

# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
### use create_engine to connect the engine to the database.

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM Album', engine)
### use pd.read_sql_query(argument, engine) 
  ## argument is the SQL code. 

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Open engine in context manager and store query result in df1
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")
    df1 = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df1.columns = rs.keys()

# Confirm that both methods yield the same result
print(df.equals(df1))

Pandas for more complex querying

# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId >= 6 ORDER BY BirthDate', engine)
  ### SELECT everything FROM Employee database
  ### WHERE the employeeID is more or equal to 6
  ### ORDER BY 'BirthDate' columns.

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
